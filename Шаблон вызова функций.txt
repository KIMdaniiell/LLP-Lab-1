• Callee-saved registers must be restored by the procedure being called. So, if it needs 
to change them, it has to change them back.
These registers are callee-saved: rbx, rbp, rsp, r12-r15, a total of seven registers.
• Caller-saved registers should be saved before invoking a function and restored after. One 
does not have to save and restore them if their value will not be of importance after.
All other registers are caller-saved.


[Алгоритм]
So, the pattern of calling a function is as follows:
• Save all caller-saved registers you want to survive function call 
(you can use push for that).
• Store arguments in the relevant registers (rdi, rsi, etc.).
• Invoke function using call.
• After function returns, rax will hold the return value.
• Restore caller-saved registers stored before the function call.
